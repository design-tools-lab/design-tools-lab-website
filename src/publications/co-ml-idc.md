title: "Collaborative Machine Learning Model Building with Families Using Co-ML"
authors: "Tiffany Tseng, Jennifer King Chen, Mona Abdelrahman, Mary Beth Kery, Fred Hohman, Adriana Hilliard, R Benjamin Shapiro"
description: "We created Co-ML â€“ a tablet-based app for learners to collaboratively build ML image classifiers through an end-to-end, iterative model-building process. In this paper, we illustrate the feasibility and potential richness of collaborative modeling by presenting an in-depth case study of a family (two children 11 and 14-years-old working with their parents) using Co-ML in a facilitated introductory ML activity at home.
