title: "Spin: Examining the role of engagement, integration, and modularity in supporting youth creating documentation"
authors: "Tiffany Tseng, Mitchel Resnick"
description: "In this paper, we contribute an evaluation of Spin, a system for youth to capture and share animations of physical design projects. We describe how educators and students used Spin in 16 different K-12 makerspaces over 6 months, ranging from 2-hour-long workshops to extended 8-week engagements. We outline the role of engagement, integration, and modularity for making documentation practice relevant and meaningful."
