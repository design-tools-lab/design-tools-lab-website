title: "Crafting a Personal Journaling Practice: Negotiating Ecosystems of Materials, Personal Context, and Community in Analog Journaling"
authors: "Katherine Lin, Juna Kawai-Yue, Adira Sklar, Lucy Hecht, Sarah Sterman, Tiffany Tseng"
description: "We report on our identification of the journaling ecosystem in which journaling practices are shaped by materials, personal context, and communities, sharing how this ecosystem plays a role in the practices and identities of journalers as they customize their journaling routine to best suit their personal goals. Using these insights, we discuss design opportunities for how future tools can better align with and reflect the rich affordances and practices of journaling on paper. "
