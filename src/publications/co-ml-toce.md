title: "Co-ML: Collaborative machine learning model building for developing dataset design practices"
authors: "Tiffany Tseng, Matt J Davidson, Luis Morales-Navarro, Jennifer King Chen, Victoria Delaney, Mark Leibowitz, Jazbo Beason, R Benjamin Shapiro"
description: "We outline a set of four data design practices (DDPs) for designing inclusive ML models and share how we designed a tablet-based application called Co-ML to foster learning of DDPs through a collaborative ML model building experience. We deployed Co-ML in a 2-week-long educational AIML Summer Camp, where youth ages 13â€“18 worked in groups to build custom ML-powered mobile applications."
