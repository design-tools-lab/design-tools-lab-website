title: "Making Make-throughs: Supporting young makers sharing design process."
authors: "Tiffany Tseng"
description: "This paper introduces the concept of make-throughs, a documentation format in which Makers share their design process throughout the development of a design project. Makethroughs capture the rich, iterative nature of a design process in which a project is constantly revised and refined over
time. In contrast to tutorials, make-through documentation
is shared throughout the design process (rather than after
a project is complete), and incorporates iteration (rather
than a finalized list of instructions)."
